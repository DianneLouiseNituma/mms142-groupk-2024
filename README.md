## Introduction

Agriculture is central to the Filipino economy and culture, yet traditional distribution systems face inefficiencies and challenges. AgriTech platforms represent a disruptive innovation, challenging these norms with technology-driven solutions. This project explores their transformative potential and their impact on farmers, supply chains, and rural communities.

## Objectives

- Analyze how AgriTech platforms meet the criteria for disruptive innovation.
- Highlight key examples of AgriTech solutions in the Philippine agricultural sector.
- Evaluate their economic, social, and technological impact.
- Identify challenges and barriers to adoption.
- Publish findings as a static website using GitHub Pages.

## Project Structure

- **`index.html`**: The main webpage summarizing the research.
- **`css/`**: Contains stylesheets for the website.
- **`images/`**: Stores media assets like charts, graphics, and photos.
- **`docs/`**: Includes supporting documents and research references.

## How to Contribute

### 1. What is the `main` branch?
- The `main` branch is the **official version** of our project, where all approved and stable updates are saved.
- Itâ€™s what our **live website** uses and reflects the final, working version of our project.
- **We donâ€™t make changes directly to `main`** to prevent breaking the site or introducing errors.

### 2. Why do we use branches?
A **branch** is a **copy of the project** where you can work on your part without affecting the `main` branch. It allows:
- **Safe editing** of files without breaking the project.
- **Proper review** before merging changes into the final version (`main`).

### 3. Whatâ€™s the workflow?

#### **Step 1: Navigate to the file you want to edit**
1. Open the repository:  
   ðŸ‘‰ [MMS-142 Group K Repository](https://github.com/MMS-142-Group-K-2024/mms142-groupk-2024)
2. Choose the file you want to edit:
   - **To add research content**: Click on `index.html`.
   - **To edit website styling**: Click on `css/styles.css`.

#### **Step 2: Create a New Branch**
1. Click the **pencil icon** in the top-right corner of the file view to start editing the file.
2. Scroll to the bottom of the page to the **Commit changes** section.
3. Select **Create a new branch for this commit and start a pull request**.  
   - This avoids overwriting each other's work and keeps your changes separate until reviewed.

4. Name the branch descriptively, such as:
   ```bash
   feature/add-introduction
   ```

#### **Step 3: Submit the Pull Request**
1. After clicking Propose changes, GitHub will direct you to create a pull request.
2. Add a title and description of what youâ€™ve changed:
   - Example title: "Added Introduction Content"
   - Example description:
        - Added content to the introduction section.
        - Updated references for AgriTech platforms.
     
3. Click Create **Pull Request**.
   

### **4. Why Use This Workflow?**
1. Protect the Main Branch:
   - Avoid accidental errors or incomplete work breaking the project.
2. Organized Collaboration:
   - Everyone works on their part independently without interference.
3. Encourages Feedback:
   - Pull requests allow for reviews and improvements.
4. Real-World Practice:
   - This is how professional teams manage projects.
