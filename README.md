## Introduction

Agriculture is central to the Filipino economy and culture, yet traditional distribution systems face inefficiencies and challenges. AgriTech platforms represent a disruptive innovation, challenging these norms with technology-driven solutions. This project explores their transformative potential and their impact on farmers, supply chains, and rural communities.

## Objectives

- Analyze how AgriTech platforms meet the criteria for disruptive innovation.
- Highlight key examples of AgriTech solutions in the Philippine agricultural sector.
- Evaluate their economic, social, and technological impact.
- Identify challenges and barriers to adoption.
- Publish findings as a static website using GitHub Pages.

## Project Structure

- **`index.html`**: The main webpage summarizing the research.
- **`css/`**: Contains stylesheets for the website.
- **`images/`**: Stores media assets like charts, graphics, and photos.
- **`docs/`**: Includes supporting documents and research references.

## How to Contribute

### 1. First, you should know what is the `main` branch
- The `main` branch is the **official version** of our project, where all approved and stable updates are saved.
- It‚Äôs what our **live website** uses and reflects the final, working version of our project.
- **We don‚Äôt make changes directly to `main`** to prevent breaking the site or introducing errors.

### 2. Why everyone should use branches?
A **branch** is a **copy of the project** where you can work on your part without affecting the `main` branch. It allows:
- **Safe editing** of files without breaking the project.
- **Proper review** before merging changes into the final version (`main`).

### 3. So what's the workflow should we all follow?

#### **Step 1: Navigate to the file you want to edit**
1. Open the repository:  
   üëâ [MMS-142 Group K Repository](https://github.com/MMS-142-Group-K-2024/mms142-groupk-2024)
2. Choose the file you want to edit:
   - **To add research content**: Click on `index.html`.
   - **To edit website styling**: Open the `css` folder and click on `styles.css.` This file controls how the website looks, including colors, fonts, spacing, and layout.
   - **To upload images**: Add your image files to the `images` folder by clicking **Add file > Upload files** at the top-right of the repository page. 

<!-- Add an empty line above --- -->
---

#### **Step 2: Create a New Branch**
1. Click the **pencil icon** in the top-right corner of the file view to start editing the file.
2. After editing, click the green **Commit changes** button.
3. ‚ö†Ô∏è**IMPORTANT:** You should select `Create a new branch for this commit and start a pull request`.  
   - Clicking that instead of `main` avoids overwriting each other's work and keeps your changes separate until reviewed.

4. Name the branch descriptively, such as:
   ```bash
   feature/add-introduction
   ```

<!-- Add an empty line above --- -->
---

#### **Step 3: Submit the Pull Request**
1. After clicking Propose changes, GitHub will direct you to create a pull request.
2. Add a title and description of what you‚Äôve changed:
   - Example title: "Added Introduction Content"
   - Example description:
        - Added content to the introduction section.
        - Updated references for AgriTech platforms.
     
3. Click Create **Pull Request**.

### **4. Why Use This Workflow?**
1. Protect the Main Branch:
   - Avoid accidental errors or incomplete work breaking the project.
2. Organized Collaboration:
   - Everyone works on their part independently without interference.
3. Encourages Feedback:
   - Pull requests allow for reviews and improvements.
4. Real-World Practice:
   - This is how professional teams manage projects.
