                <h2>Climate Change</h2>
                <p>
                    Unpredictable weather patterns, such as floods, droughts, and typhoons, reduce crop yields and disrupt planting cycles, making farming more uncertain and less productive.

                <h2>Natural and Manmade Crises</h2>
                <p>
                    Natural events like the COVID-19 pandemic and outbreaks such as African Swine Fever (ASF) significantly disrupt agricultural production, causing labor shortages and affecting livestock and crop yields. Policies like rice tariffication and international conflicts, such as the Ukraine-Russia war, affect food supply chains and agricultural markets.

                <h2>Population Growth and Increased Crop Demand</h2>
                <p>
                    As the population grows, there is a higher demand for food, putting pressure on the agricultural sector to produce more. This increases the strain on land and resources, leading to potential overuse and reduced productivity over time.

                <h2>Technological Limitations</h2>
                <p>
                    Many farmers lack access to modern farming technologies and equipment, hindering their ability to improve yields, manage resources efficiently, and adapt to changing conditions. This limits their potential for growth and innovation in the sector.
